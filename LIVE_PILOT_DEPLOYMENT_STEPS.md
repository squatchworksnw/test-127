# Live Pilot Deployment Steps

Use this checklist to prepare the GitHub Pages app and Supabase project for manual pilot testing with real Owner, Admin, and Submitter/Contractor accounts.

This is a pilot package, not a production launch package.

## 1. Exact Files To Deploy To GitHub Pages

Deploy only the static app runtime files listed below.

Root files:

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `app.js`

Runtime folders:

- `auth/roles.js`
- `auth/session.js`
- `components/cards.js`
- `components/forms.js`
- `services/auth-service.js`
- `services/demo-service.js`
- `services/import-review-service.js`
- `services/interaction-service.js`
- `services/mappers.js`
- `services/materials-service.js`
- `services/supabase-service.js`
- `services/sync-service.js`
- `state/app-state.js`
- `styles/tokens/tokens.css`
- `sync/pending-queue.js`
- `views/registry.js`
- `views/today-dashboard.js`
- `views/work-orders.js`
- `views/documents.js`
- `views/projects-budget.js`
- `views/materials.js`
- `views/review-queue.js`
- `views/fleet.js`

External browser dependencies loaded by `index.html`:

- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/xlsx@0.18.5/dist/xlsx.full.min.js`
- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pdfjs-dist@3.11.174/build/pdf.min.js`
- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2`

Keep these files in the repo for operators, but they do not need to be served as app runtime files:

- `PILOT_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
- `SECURITY_TRUST_REVIEW.md`
- `LIVE_PILOT_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md`
- `sql/rls_verification.sql`

Do not deploy:

- `_incoming_working_loop/`
- `tests/`
- local screenshots
- private notes
- temporary downloads
- Supabase service-role keys
- `.env` files or any secret-bearing config

Important:

- GitHub Pages is static hosting only.
- The frontend may contain the Supabase publishable/anon key.
- Never put a Supabase service-role key in frontend code or GitHub Pages.

## 2. Exact Supabase SQL / Scripts Before Testing

Run this verification script before pilot testing:

- `sql/rls_verification.sql`

This script is read-only. It inspects RLS, policies, and important columns. It does not modify data.

Do not run this for the current pilot unless intentionally enabling the future native Materials / Takeoffs schema:

- `sql/materials_takeoffs_proposed.sql`

The current pilot does not require `materials_takeoffs_proposed.sql`. Materials/estimate submissions can continue through Review Queue and existing operational records.

Before testing, confirm the live Supabase project already contains the expected operational tables/views:

- `field_ops_workspaces`
- `field_ops_memberships`
- `field_ops_my_workspaces`
- `field_ops_import_reviews`
- `field_ops_documents`
- `field_ops_work_orders`
- `field_ops_buildings`
- `field_ops_spaces`
- `field_ops_assets`
- `field_ops_projects`
- `field_ops_vendors`
- `field_ops_vehicles`
- `field_ops_fuel_receipts`
- `field_ops_budget_items`
- `field_ops_vehicle_alerts`

Also confirm:

- Supabase Auth is enabled.
- The GitHub Pages URL is allowed in Supabase Auth redirect URLs.
- The `documents` Storage bucket exists.
- Storage policies allow workspace-safe uploads/downloads.
- `field_ops_my_workspaces` returns the correct role for each pilot user.

## 3. Exact Test Accounts Needed

Create or confirm these real Supabase Auth users. All three should belong to the same pilot workspace first.

Owner account:

- Email: ___________________________
- Workspace ID: ____________________
- Membership role: `owner`
- Expected access: full command center, Settings, diagnostics, Review Queue approval, Work Orders, archive/restore.
- Pass/Fail: _______________________
- Notes: ___________________________

Admin account:

- Email: ___________________________
- Workspace ID: ____________________
- Membership role: `admin`
- Expected access: daily operations workspace, Review Queue, Work Orders, Projects, Fleet, Documents, Materials, Reports, limited Settings.
- Pass/Fail: _______________________
- Notes: ___________________________

Submitter / Contractor account:

- Email: ___________________________
- Workspace ID: ____________________
- Membership role: `submitter`
- Expected access: simple portal only, request submission, document/photo upload, estimates/material submissions, My Submissions.
- Pass/Fail: _______________________
- Notes: ___________________________

Workspace isolation accounts:

- Workspace A user email: ___________________________
- Workspace A ID: ___________________________________
- Workspace B user email: ___________________________
- Workspace B ID: ___________________________________
- Expected result: Workspace A cannot read/write Workspace B records, and Workspace B cannot read/write Workspace A records.
- Pass/Fail: _______________________
- Notes: ___________________________

## 4. Run `sql/rls_verification.sql`

1. Open the Supabase Dashboard.
2. Select the live pilot project.
3. Open SQL Editor.
4. Click New query.
5. Open local file `sql/rls_verification.sql`.
6. Paste the entire file into the SQL editor.
7. Click Run.
8. Review the first result set.
9. Confirm every `field_ops_%` base table has `rls_enabled = true`.
10. Review the policy result set.
11. Confirm operational tables have policies for Owner/Admin access.
12. Confirm submitter-facing tables have limited intake/upload policies.
13. Review the column result set.
14. Confirm workspace-owned tables include `workspace_id`.
15. Confirm archive-capable tables include `archived_at`.
16. Confirm intake/review tables track `submitted_by`, `created_by`, or `reviewed_by` where applicable.
17. Save a screenshot or copy of the results with the pilot notes.

Stop the pilot if:

- Any operational base table has RLS disabled.
- Workspace-owned records do not have `workspace_id`.
- Submitters can directly create live operational records.
- A user from one workspace can read records from another workspace.
- Storage files can be opened by the wrong workspace.

Notes: _____________________________

## 6. Known Limitations Before Pilot

- The repo includes `sql/rls_verification.sql`, but not a complete authoritative Supabase schema/RLS migration for every table.
- Live RLS and Storage policies must be verified in the actual Supabase project before using real operational data.
- Review Queue conversion has frontend/service duplicate prevention, but should eventually move into a single database RPC/transaction for stronger concurrency safety.
- Audit readiness exists conceptually, but there is not yet a complete immutable audit log for every create, update, approve, archive, restore, and upload action.
- Offline retry is limited to pending text/data writes. File uploads should show pending/failed until online and accepted by Supabase.
- Conflict resolution is not yet a full multi-device merge engine.
- Materials / Takeoffs native tables are proposed only. Do not run the proposed migration unless intentionally expanding the pilot scope.
- GitHub Pages can cache aggressively. After deploys, testers may need a hard refresh.
- Supabase Auth redirect URLs must be configured for the exact GitHub Pages URL.
- The publishable Supabase key is public by design. A service-role key must never be added to the app.
- This package is ready for controlled pilot testing, not broad production rollout.
